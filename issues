Issues found and pending fixes.

Pending fixes detected:

Issues:

* Huge programs runs laggy, slow and not responsive when launched from rshell. This will require research about the issue. Possible reason may
be related with the size of the address space needed by those binaries since it's huge more bigger than the one used by rshell.

Crashes:

Issues solved:

* Crash when no argument is passed and just <enter> is pressed (malloc failed or segmentation fault).
* command.args[0] should contain the name of the binary called. Should be command.args[0] = command.binary.
* Memory Leak: Implement method to free the allocated memory for the contents of the struct command.

NOTES:

With the implementation so far rshell is capable of running general GNU utilities without any problem such as ls, pwd, clear, touch, whoami, and so on.
Git seems to work fine with rshell.
